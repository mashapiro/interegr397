Providing adequate energy storage to meet sustainable energy goals demands more than twice the projected supply of lithium by 2030 [1]. Energy storage for renewable energy sources, electronic devices, and electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries [2]. Hence, society needs to increase lithium production, recycle lithium, or develop alternatives to lithium to meet sustainability goals [1]. 
Donated blood components are an important commodity in modern medicine. When people donate blood, technicians often process the whole blood to extract components, including cell pieces called platelets. Platelets are involved in many healing processes in the body [1]. Because of this, donated platelets are used in transfusions for patients with defective platelets and platelet injections to speed recovery from injuries [1]. 
Needle injections can cause pain and discourage people from receiving vaccinations. The fear of needles and its associated pain affects about 25% of the adult population [1]. This fear of needles has been attributed to 7% of parent’s and 8% of children’s noncompliance with immunization [2]. 
Animal feeding operations produce large amounts of manure. United States concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) generate nearly twice as much organic waste as the entire U.S. human population[1] [2].    
Conventional agricultural fertilizers decrease soil quality. Over the past 50 years, agriculture has become increasingly intensified [1]. Conventional agriculture relies on synthetic fertilizers, which over time deplete soil quality, accelerate erosion, and pollute our water [2].  According to a Yale meta-analysis of 90 studies, conventional agricultural practices decrease organic matter, leading to erosion and lower crop yields [3]. Soil degradation threatens food security for future generations [4]. Conservation agriculture is a proposed alternative which focuses on protecting soil quality [5]. 
Engineers design digital circuits using two methods, both having unique costs and benefits. As digital circuits, or computer chips, become more complex and widely used, the method of planning and analyzing them--called chip design--requires more powerful tools. The industry standard method focuses on the interconnections of building blocks in a chip, allowing for fine-tuned control of the design, and increased chip quality in performance and efficiency [1]. This granular, albeit laborious method is called RTL [1]. A rival method relinquishes this fine-tuned control to software tools, accelerating the design process at the cost of chip quality [1]. This method allows designers to focus solely on algorithms to be implemented by chips [2]. This higher-level method is called HLS [2]. Industry members must evaluate RTL and HLS’s costs and benefits to determine the best method for their needs.

Healthcare associated infections are a common and significant complication for hospital patients.
In a survey of 11,282 patients, 4% reported having at least one healthcare associated infection [1]. Hospitals do not always adequately disinfect surfaces, so bacteria can build up between cleanings and remain there until the next cleaning [2], [3]. The remaining bacteria  contribute to infections [4]. This is most significant on frequently touched surfaces including door handles, bed rails, IV poles, and trays [4].

Production of meat causes greenhouse gas emissions and other issues.
Agricultural meat production leads to negative environmental impacts. Animal digestion produces methane emissions, and processing produces carbon dioxide emissions [1]. Another consequence is deforestation resulting from expanding grazing land [1]. Aside from environmental effects, the consumption of red meat has historically been viewed as a potential culprit for health problems including cardiovascular disease and even cancer; however, the research is not conclusive on health risks regarding red meat [2]. Experts recommend limiting the consumption of processed and red meat in favor of fish and poultry [3]. Meat substitutes serve as alternatives to traditional meat in hopes of solving these problems. New trends in food and the mixing of cultures have posed options like tofu made of soy, black bean burgers, insects as a protein source, and even cultivated meat, created by sophisticated laboratory processes [6].
